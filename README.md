# Horiseon Code Refactor
This site was developed in mind with refactoring code that was already provided by the client. The client had a goal of ensuring that their codebase followed accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engine optimization.
## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to make the code as neat and semantically appropriate as possible. The original code provided by the client lacked basic semantic tags and logical html structure, a definitive title, alt attributes for images, and had links that were broken. To optimize this site, all of the before mentioned kinks were ironed out to provide a visually pleasing code that meets accessibility standards, as requested by the client.
## Tech/Framework Used
Built with Visual Code Studio
## Code Example
Here is an example of how the code has been refactored to ensure accessibility standards through semantic tags, commenting, and html structure, with the same methods applied to the CSS code.
